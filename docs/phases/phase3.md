# Phase 3: Editing and Displaying Posts

## Rails

## Backbone
### Models

### Collections

### Views
* PostForm
* ArtistForm

## Gems/Libraries
* Paperclip gem




I plan to use a third-party library to add functionality to the `ArtworkForm` and
`ArtistForm` views in this phase. I am going to integrate the Paperclip gem so users
can easily upload images from their computer/facebook/instagram. I will also
add this same functionality so users can upload an avatar to their profiles.
